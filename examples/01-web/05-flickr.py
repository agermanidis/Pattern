# This example downloads an image from Flickr (http://flickr.com).
# Acquiring the image data takes three Flickr queries: 
# - the first query with Flickr.search() retrieves a list of results,
# - the second query is executed behind the scenes in the FlickResult.url property,
# - the third query downloads the actual image data using this URL.
# It is a good idea to cache results from Flickr locally,
# which is what the cached=True parameter does.

# You should obtain your own license key at:
# http://www.flickr.com/services/api/
# Otherwise you will be sharing the default key with all users of this module.
