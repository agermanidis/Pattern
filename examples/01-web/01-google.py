# The web module has a SearchEngine class with a search() method 
# that yields a list of Result objects.
# Each Result has url, title, date, description, date and author properties.
# Subclasses of SearchEngine include: 
# Google, Yahoo, Bing, Twitter, Wikipedia, Flickr.

# This example retrieves results from Google based on a given query.
# The Google search engine can handle SEARCH, IMAGE, NEWS and BLOG type searches.

# You should obtain your own license key at:
# http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html
# Otherwise you will be sharing the default key with all users of this module.
