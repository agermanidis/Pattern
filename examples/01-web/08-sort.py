# The web module includes an interesting sort() algorithm (De Smedt et al. 2007)
# that classifies search terms according to a search engine's total results count.
# When a context is defined, sorts according to relevancy to the context, e.g.:
# sort(terms=["black", "green", "red"], context="Darth Vader") =>
# yields "black" as the best candidate, 
# because "black Darth Vader" is more common in search results.
